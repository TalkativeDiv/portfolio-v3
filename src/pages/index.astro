      Hi, I'm Abhi, a web developer and student living in Washington, DC.
    </h2>
    <p class="leading-[1.75]">
      I spend my free time either learning new ideas or building upon those new
      ideas. I am personally interested in Neural Networks, Web Development, and
      Data Science. I usually program, paint, or read in my spare time.
      <br />
      <br />
      Day to day, I work with React, NextJS, Typescript, and TailwindCSS. I have dipped into a bit of HonoJS, Express, Django, and Go.
